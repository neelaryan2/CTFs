according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} should be able to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} of course, flies anyway because flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't care what humans think is impossible. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} breakfast is ready! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't. 
ma! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} got a thing going here. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} told you, stop flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in the house! 
hey, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
three days college. i'm glad flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. 
hi, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} artie, growing a mustache? looks good. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} guess he could have just gotten out of the way. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. 
well, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} today we are men. 
students, faculty, distinguished flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} heard it's just orientation. 
we know that you, as a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive. 
our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
at honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} existence. 
these flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} are stress-testing a new helmet technology. 
catches that little strand of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} that hangs after you pour it. 
of course. most flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} jobs are small ones. 
but flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. 
the same job the rest of your life? flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} didn't know that. 
you'll be happy to know that flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. 
but, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} how could they never have told us that? 
why would you question anything? we're flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know. but you know what i'm talking about. 
you're sky freaks! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} love it! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} love it! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} wonder where they were. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know. 
outside the hive, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} who knows where, doing who knows what. 
look. that's more pollen than you and flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} will see in a lifetime. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} make too much of it. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} never thought i'd knock him out. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can autograph that. 
maybe flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} am. 
are you flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} enough? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} might be. it all depends on what 0900 means. 
you know, dad, the more flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think about it, 
maybe the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} field just isn't right for me. 
janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} you are so funny sometimes. 
you're not funny! you're going into flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} our son, the stirrer! 
wait till you see the sticks flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} could say anything right now. 
let's open some flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} and celebrate! 
pollen counting, stunt flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... 
a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} died. makes an opening. see? he's dead. another dead one. 
heating, cooling, stunt flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} what do you think flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} should... flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have to, before flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} go to work for the rest of my life. 
you got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} cannot flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in rain. 
also, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} got a couple of reports of root flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} being poured on us. 
and a reminder for you rookies, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't believe i'm out! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} feel so fast and free! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. 
that's pollen power. more pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} for us. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know, but i'm loving this color. 
not like a flower, but flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} like it. 
my sweet lord of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't think these are flowers. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think he knows. 
you can start packing up, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} because you're about to eat it! 
there's a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in the car! 
hi, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} gotta get home. 
can't flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in rain. can't flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in rain. can't flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in rain. 
mayday! mayday! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} going down! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} could you close the window please? 
check out my new resume. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} made it into a fold-out brochure. you see? folds out. 
oh, no. more humans. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't need this. 
nah, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't go for that... kind of stuff. 
when flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} say. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} predicted global warming. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} could feel it getting hotter. at first flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thought it was just me. 
wait! stop! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
right. bye, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thanks. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} next week? yogurt night? 
sure, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} you know, whatever. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} gotta say something. she saved my life. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} gotta say something. 
what would flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} say? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} could really get in trouble. it's a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} law. you're not supposed to talk to a human. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't believe i'm doing this. i've got to. 
oh, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't do it. come on! 
no. yes. no. do it. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't. 
how should flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} start it? "you like jazz?" no, that's no good. 
yes, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know i'm dreaming. but flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't recall going to bed. 
this is a bit of a surprise to me. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} mean, you're a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} am. and i'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. 
and if it wasn't for you... flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} had to thank you. it's just how flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was raised. 
that was a little weird. i'm talking with a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
i'm talking to a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} and the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} is talking to me! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} just want to say i'm grateful. 
same way you did, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} guess. "mama, dada, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} you pick it up. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} are funny. if we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} mean... flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know. coffee? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't want to put you out. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} hate to impose. 
actually, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} would love a cup. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} shouldn't. 
no, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know if you know anything about fashion. 
he's making the tie in the cab as they're flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} up madison. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thought you said guatemalan. 
why would flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} marry a watermelon?" 
is that a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} joke? 
so, what are you gonna do, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
about work? flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} want to do my part for the hive, but flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't do it the way they want. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know how you feel. 
my parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} wanted to be a florist. 
no way! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know that area. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} lost a toe ring there once. 
anyway, this has flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} great. 
sorry flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} couldn't finish it. if flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} did, i'd be up the rest of my life. 
can flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} take a piece of this with me? 
all right. well, then... flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} guess i'll see you around. or not. 
ok, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
humans! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't believe you were with humans! 
well, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} met someone. 
you did? was she flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't get by that face. 
no, no. that's a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} law. you wouldn't break a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} law. 
her name's flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
you're flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and m-80s! one-eighth a stick of dynamite! 
you have got to start thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} my friend. thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
you know what your problem is, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} gotta start thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
it's flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} three days! why aren't you working? 
you have no job. you're barely a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
would it kill you to make a little flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} come out. your father's talking to you. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} i'm talking to you! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} told you not to yell at him. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} just hope she's flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
how come you don't flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} everywhere? 
yeah, ok, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} see, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} see. 
dumb flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} lost a cousin to italian vogue. 
how did this get here? cute flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} golden blossom, ray liotta private select? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} never heard of him. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} make it. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know who makes it! and it's hard to make it! 
it's just flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know about this! this is stealing! a lot of stealing! 
he is here. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} sense it. 
well, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} guess i'll go home now and just leave this nice flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} out, with no one around. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} knew flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} heard something. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can talk. and now you'll start talking! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't understand. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thought we were friends. 
the last thing we want to do is upset flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
where is the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} coming from? tell me where! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} farms! it comes from flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} farms! 
do flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} look dead? they will wipe anything that moves. where you headed? 
to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} farms. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} am onto something huge here. 
jump on! it's your only chance, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
whassup, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} boy? 
just a row of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} jars, as far as the eye could see. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} mean, that flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} ours. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} hang tight. we're all jammed in. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} about to leave the building! so long, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} knew i'd catch y'all down here. 
a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} got a brain the size of a pinhead. 
they make the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} and we make the money. 
"they make the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} and we make the money"? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
our flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! 
this is worse than anything bears have done! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} intend to do something. 
oh, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} stop. 
who told you humans are taking our flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} that's a rumor. 
he's flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} talking to humans. 
make out? flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} dated a cricket once in san antonio. those crazy legs kept me up all night. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} this is what you want to do with your life? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} want to do it for all our lives. nobody works harder than flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
dad, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} remember you coming home so overworked 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} remember that. 
what right do they have to our flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
even if it's true, what can one flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} do? 
no more flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} beards! 
a tri-county flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} intends to sue the human race for stealing our flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} packaging it and profiting from it illegally! 
tomorrow night on flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} larry king, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy ladies, out this week on hexagon. 
tonight we're talking to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
did you ever think, "i'm a kid from the hive. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't do this"? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have never flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} afraid to change the world. 
what about flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} oolumbus? flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} gandhi? bejesus? 
the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} century. 
it was my grandmother, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} she's 81. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} her backhand's a joke! 
is that that same flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
hello, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
this is flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
yeah, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} remember you. timberland, size ten and a half. vibram sole, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} believe. 
listen, you better go 'cause we're really flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} working. 
you poor thing. you two have flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} at this for hours! 
yes, and flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} here has flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} a huge help. 
just one. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} try not to use the competition. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have good qualities. and it takes my mind off the shop. instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} must hate those fake things! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} guess. 
am flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} sure? when i'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, "honey, i'm home," without paying a royalty! 
it's an incredible scene here in downtown manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can actually speak. 
what have we gotten into here, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} just got a chill. 
well, if it isn't the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} team. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} v. the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} industry is now in session. 
mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} you're representing the five food companies collectively? 
mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} you're representing all the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} of the world? 
mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} your opening statement, please. 
if we lived in the topsy-turvy world mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} imagines, just think of what would it mean. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! 
talking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. i'm just an ordinary flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} pretty important to me. it's important to all flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} we invented it! we make it. and we protect it with our lives. 
i'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} you not only take everything we have but everything we are! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} wish he'd dress like that all the time. so nice! 
so, mr. klauss vanderhayden of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} farms, big company you have. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} suppose so. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} see you also own flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} and honron! 
yes, they provide flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} for our farms. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} find that to be a very disturbing term. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't imagine you employ any flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} do you? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} couldn't hear you. 
no. because you don't free flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} you keep flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
bears kill flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
so, mr. sting, thank you for being here. your name intrigues me. where have flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} heard it before? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was with a band called the police. 
but you've never flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} a police officer, have you? 
no, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} haven't. 
no, you haven't. and so here we have yet another example of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. 
have you ever flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} stung, mr. sting? because i'm feeling a little stung, sting. or should flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} say... mr. gordon m. sumner! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} enjoy what flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} do. is that a crime? 
not yet it isn't. but is this what it's come to for you? exploiting tiny, helpless flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? 
watch it, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} could blow right now! 
order! order, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} say! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think the jury's on our side. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} didn't think you were coming. 
no, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was just late flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} tried to call, but... the battery. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} didn't want all this to go to waste, 
so flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} called flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} luckily, he was free. 
there's a little left. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} could heat it up. 
so flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} hear you're quite a tennis player. i'm not much for the game myself. the ball's a little grabby. 
that's where flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} usually sit. right... there. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. 
you think flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't see what you're doing? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know how hard it is to find the right job. we have that in common. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. 
that's just what flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was thinking about doing. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} let flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} borrow your razor for his fuzz. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} hope that was all right. 
funny, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} just can't seem to recall that! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think something stinks in here! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} love the smell of flowers. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} i'm wearing a chapstick hat! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} what are you doing?! 
you know, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't even like flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't eat it! 
we need to talk! he's just a little flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
and he happens to be the nicest flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} i've met in a long time! 
fine! talking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} no yogurt night... 
goodbye, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
and for your information, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know it's got an aftertaste! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} like it! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} always felt there was some kind of barrier between flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} and me. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} couldn't overcome it. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} believe mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} is about out of ideas. 
we would like to call mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} to the stand. 
don't worry. the only thing flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} i'll ask you what the real flag is flag{ju5t_4n0th3r_str1ng5_pr0bl3m_0159394921} think we'd all like to know. 
i've seen a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} documentary or two. from what flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} children? 
oh, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
you're an illegitimate flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} aren't you, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
he's denouncing flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't! it's what he wants! 
oh, i'm hit!! oh, lordy, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} am hit! 
the venom! the venom is coursing through my veins! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} felled by a winged beast of destruction! you see? you can't treat them like equals! they're striped savages! stinging's the only thing they know! it's their way! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} stay with me. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't feel my legs. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} will have order in this court. order! order, please! 
the case of the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} versus the human race took a pointed turn against the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} yesterday when one of their legal team stung layton t. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
i... flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} blew the whole case, didn't i? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't explain it. it was all... all adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy! 
of course. i'm sorry. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flew us right into this. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} hear they put the roaches in motels. that doesn't sound so bad. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} they check in, but they don't check out! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't smoke. 
right. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't smoke. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't smoke! 
but some flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} are smoking. 
well, your honor, it's interesting. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} are trained to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} actually heard a funny story about... 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! 
mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} i'm afraid i'm going to have to consider mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} motion. 
it's a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} smoker! 
what, this? this harmless little contraption? this couldn't hurt a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} let alone a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
look at what has happened to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} who have never flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} asked, "smoking or non?" is this what nature intended for us? to be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? 
living out our lives as flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} slaves to the white man? 
ladies and gentlemen, please, free these flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
free the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} free the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} free the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} free the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} free the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
the court finds in favor of the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} we won! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} knew you could do it! high-five! 
all the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} will finally belong to the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
this is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} how much flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} is out there? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} who are you wearing? 
my sweater is ralph lauren, and flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have no pants. 
what if flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} right? 
we've flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} living the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} way a long time, 27 million years. 
first, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} work camps. 
then we want back the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} that was ours to begin with, every last drop. 
and we will no longer tolerate flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} nicknames... 
...unnecessary inclusion of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think we need to shut down! 
shut down flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} production! 
stop making flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
we're shutting flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} production! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} you wouldn't believe how much flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was out there. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} heard your uncle carl was on his way to san antonio with a cricket. 
at least we got our flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} back. 
sometimes flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think, so what if humans liked our flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} who wouldn't? 
it's the greatest thing in the world! flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was excited to be part of making it. 
this was my new desk. this was my new job. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} wanted to do it really well. and now... 
now flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't understand why they're not happy. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thought their lives would be better! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} really changes people. 
you know, i'm gonna guess flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} didn't think flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} not needing to make flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} would affect all these things. 
it's not just flowers. fruits, vegetables, they all need flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know this is also partly my fault. 
listen, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} sorry, but flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} gotta get going. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} had to open my mouth and talk. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} why are you leaving? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} just wanna say i'm sorry. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} never meant it to turn out like this. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know. me neither. 
flowers, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} pollen! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know. 
ok, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} made a huge mistake. 
i've ruined the planet. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} wanted to help you with the flower shop. i've made it worse. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thought maybe you were remodeling. 
but flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't want to hear it! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know every flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} plant and flower bud in this park. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} have an idea. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} bloome, ftd. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} could be the princess, and you could be the pea! 
yes, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} got it. 
where should flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} sit? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} believe i'm the pea. 
has it flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in your possession the entire time? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know. just having some fun. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think this is gonna work. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} these are cut flowers with no water. they'll never make it. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} gotta get up there and talk to them. 
can flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} get help with the sky mall magazine? i'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. 
good afternoon, passengers. this is your captain. would a miss flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} bloome in 24b please report to the cockpit? and please hurry! 
is that another flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} joke? 
no one's flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} the plane! 
this is flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} bloome. i'm a florist from new york. 
from the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} trial?! oh, great. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} this is nothing more than a big metal flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} a plane. 
wait, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} fresh from his legal victory... 
that's flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
just a minute. there's a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} on that plane. 
i'm quite familiar with mr. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} and his no-account compadres. 
technically, a flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} shouldn't be able to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} at all. 
the way we work may be a mystery to you. making flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} takes a lot of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} doing a lot of small jobs. 
that's why flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} want to get flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} back to working together. that's the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} way! we're not made of jell-o. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} what happened?! 
wait, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think we were on autopilot the whole time. 
that may have flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} helping me. 
so it turns out flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} cannot flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} a plane. 
our only chance is if flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} do what i'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't do this! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} pull yourself together. you have to snap out of it! 
how is the plane flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? 
where? flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't see anything. can you? 
come on. you got to think flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
wait a minute. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} think i'm feeling something. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't know. it's strong, pulling me. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} aim for the flower. 
cut the engines. we're going in on flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} power. ready, boys? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
this is insane, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
this's the only way flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} know how to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
am flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} in an insect-like pattern? 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} we did it! you taught me how to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} it worked! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} saw the flower! that was genius! 
that means this is our last chance. we're the only ones who make flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} pollinate flowers and dress like this. 
are we going to be flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} or just museum of natural history keychains? 
we're flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
hold on, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} here. you've earned this. 
i'm a pollen jock! and it's a perfect fit. all flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} gotta do are the sleeves. 
that's our flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
mom! the flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} are back! 
if anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! 
here's your change. have a great afternoon! can flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} help who's next? 
would you like some flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} with that? 
it is flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't forget these. 
milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. and flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} don't see a nickel! 
sometimes flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} just feel like a piece of meat! 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} had no idea. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} i'm sorry. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was already a blood-sucking parasite. all flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} needed was a briefcase. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} just got this huge tulip order, and flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can't get them anywhere. 
you're a lifesaver, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} can flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} help who's next? 
all right, scramble, jocks! it's time to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
thank you, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
that flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} is living my life! 
let it go, flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
beautiful day to flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} was dying to get out of that office. 
you have got to start thinking flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} my friend. 
flag{n0t_th3_fl4g_l0l} had virtually no rehearsal for that.
